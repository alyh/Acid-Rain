Acid Rain
--------------

This simple android game was developped for the [2012 AppJam](http://www.techu.me/2012/06/first-techu-me-app-jam-a-great-success/) and did quite well against the tough competition. You can still see the original showcase site [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22957577/index2.html) for screenshots and a brief explantion.

If you'd like to add or improve anything to the game, you're more than welcome to.
